LABOR.digital - Node.js 10 Base Image - Dev Edition
The development edition for our Node.js 10 docker base image. Why a separate dev version? You can use this version of the base image for dev or pipeline builds that require access to npm or jest (which are already pre-installed in this version) and simply pass the required artifacts to your build production image.

Note: As we are a company based in germany the locale and timezone are already preconfigured for germany!

## Postcardware
You're free to use these images, but if it makes it to your production environment we highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using.

Our address is: LABOR.digital - Fischtorplatz 21 - 55116 Mainz, Germany
